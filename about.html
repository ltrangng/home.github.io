            <p>I was a low-tech tree hugger.</p>
            <p>I love the land and want to see great things growing from it. That’s how I became a landscape architect.</p>
            <p>I grew up in Vietnam without the internet. There was no access to computers. There was even scanty food or medicines. People who were born before 1986 in Vietnam are often seen smaller. I am tiny even in Vietnamese standard. That’s how I could see things that big people often miss.</p>
            <p>I wanted to see things, so I traveled. My friends and I started travelling around the country on scooters only with a map book. That was before Google and Facebook. Later I couchsurfed in 25 countries with my smartphone assistant. I love talking with people I met and learn about their life, their hope and dreams. People have more similarities than differences. We all need good food, family and friends, a little sunshine. These experiences are invaluable. I feel rich with what I’ve experienced. That’s how I think: <em>Designing experiences would be cool!</em> </p>
            <p>The world has changed. Music has changed. The way people communicate with each other and organize among communities has also changed. How much I love the simplicity of an analog life; I know the Digital Age has a fundamental impact in human society. I made myself ready and adapted to this transition. My work has shifted slowly from the built environment to its virtual infrastructure. I don’t think everyone is aware that there will be even more disruptive changes. When people don’t understand what is going on, it is easy to get hurt.</p>
            <p>That’s when I thought: <em>I should do something</em>. I gathered all necessary education and decided to become an awesome UX designer.</p>
